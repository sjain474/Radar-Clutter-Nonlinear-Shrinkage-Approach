This is the code supplement for the paper:

D. L. Donoho , M. Gavish and I. M. Johnstone,
"OPTIMAL SHRINKAGE OF EIGENVALUES IN THE SPIKED COVARIANCE MODEL",
https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0851

All the code provided is Matlab source code.

There are three subdirectories:

./shrinkers

    calculate optimal shrinkers.

    the function optimal_shrinkage uses analytical formulae and can adapt to
    unknown noise. It implements the formulae provided in the paper. Not all 26
    loss functions have an analytic formula.

    the function numerical_shrinkage uses numerical optimization to solve for
    the optimal shrinkers.

./tests

    compare numerical and analytic shrinkage, to verify correctness of the
    analytic formula.
    
    the main script is compare_all.

./figures : 

  Generate the figures in the paper, and their analogies for different aspect
  ratios. (The paper only contained figures for aspect ratio gamma=1.0).
  
  the main script is make_all_figures.

  the function tabulate_new tabulate optimal shrinkers.

  the function plot_shrinkers creates comparison plots between any set of 
    desired optimal shrinkers, for a given aspect ratio.
